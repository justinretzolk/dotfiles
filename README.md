# dotfiles

To install:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/justinretzolk/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
You will need to log out/back in in order to switch shells.

*Note: This was a pretty major refactor that I drifted away from for a time. Will be coming back around to address some further features/updates. Want to make sure to get this off of my machine before anything catastrophic happens.*
